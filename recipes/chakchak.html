        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs just untill well blended. Add 2 teaspoons sugar, salt and milk. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
            <li>Turn out on a floored board. Knead just enough to form a ball.</li>
            <li>Place in a lightly oiled container that has a lid and allow to rest for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After an hour remove dough and knead slightly. Divide into 2 sections form into round disks for rolling, Place one back into container.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch. Try to roll into a rectangle instead of a circle.</li>
            <li>When the dough is the right thickness, liberally flour the front and back of the dough. Cut long strips 1-1 1/2 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Flour the front and back of the strips and stack 4 on top of one another.</li>
            <li>Going crosswise, cut through all 4 layers, creating narrow noodles about 1/8 inch wide.</li>
            <li>When you are done cutting, dust with more flour if necessary to keep noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>Pour enough oil into a pot to make deep frying possible. Bring the oil temperature to about 375 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Shake off excess flour and deep fry in batches, being careful not to overload the pan. Mix slightly to insure all noodles cook evenly. Fry until golden.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oil with a sieve and place on paper towel to absorb any extra oil. Finish deep frying all the noodles.</li>
            <li>Place honey in a saucepan, and over medium heat, bring to just a boil, mixing constantly.</li>
            <li>Add sugar and heat until the mixture comes to a boil and all the sugar crystal have melted.</li>
            <li>Place a third of the fried noodles in a bowl. Pour 1/3 of the honey mixture over the noodles, tossing with a spoon to coat them all.</li>
            <li>Place another third of the noodles in a bowl, and mix with 1/3 of the honey mixture, then finally the rest of the noodles and honey.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture on your cake dish. Dip your hands in the cold water. Pressing on the noodles firm enough to remove spaces. Form into a hill shape.</li>
