            <li>Using the whisk attachment on medium speed, mix together: 2/3 cup buttermilk, 1tbsp of sour cream, 2 cups warm water, 2 eggs and 1 1/2tsp salt until well blended.</li>
            <li>Switch to dough hook and add 4 cups flour. Mix on speed 2 until well blended.</li>
            <li>Add 3 more cups of flour (one at a time). Add the rest of the flour 1tbsp at a time, until the dough is no longer sticking to the sides of the bowl. Once it is no longer sticking to the bowl, continue to mix 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Heat 1tbsp oil in a medium skillet. Add onion and saute until golden and soft. Add garlic and saute another minute.</li>
            <li>Mix together pork, turkey, onion & garlic mix, 3/4tsp salt, 1/2tsp pepper and 1tsp hot sauce (optional).</li>
            <li>Shape a portion of the dough into a 1 to 2 -inch thick log. Cut off 1 piece at a time and roll into disks to form a 1.5-inch circle with rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Place 1tsp pelmeni filling in the center.</li>
            <li>Lose the edges and pinch together.</li>
            <li>Pinch the corners together to form a diaper shape.</li>
            <li>Place pelmeni onto a well-floured cutting board. Arrange pelmeni evenly on the cutting board, sprinkle with flour and place in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Once they are fully frozen, put them in large ziploc bags, sprinkle with flour and freeze them for future enjoyment.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil (add salt). Add frozen pelmeni and return to a boil. They should float to the top, then boil for 3 minutes longer. Drain pelmeni and place them in a clean bowl.</li>
